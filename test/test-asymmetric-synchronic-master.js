// Test 1.
//
// This creates some workers and then sets up SynchronicMasterUpdates
// and SynchronicWorkerUpdates objects as a communication channel.
//
// Initially the workers all listen on the SynchronicMasterUpdates.
// The values transmitted on this channel will be worker IDs.  When a
// worker observes its own ID on the channel, it goes off and does
// some work and then writes its ID to the SynchronicWorkerUpdates
// channel and goes back to waiting.  The master will listen on that
// channel and when it sees that a worker has completed its task it
// will send the next worker ID to the workers.  And so on.
//
// This more or less just tests basic functionality.  All the workers
// will awake when the master writes a value and will then need to
// check the value and to listen again if the value is for some other
// worker.
