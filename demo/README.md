Demo programs showcasing the various features of the library.

* mandelbrot-animation is a Mandelbrot set animation built on the asymmetric-barrier.
* mandelbrot-animation2 is a Mandelbrot set animation built on the Par framework.  It gets better performance than the simple program by automatically tiling the computation, and by overlapping computation and display.
* renderWorld is a benchmark program authored by Intel (originally for Parallel Javascript testing), computing and displaying a flight over a Minecraft-like landscape.  It can be run both on the main thread and in workers, using the Par framework.
