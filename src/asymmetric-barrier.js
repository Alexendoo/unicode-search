// Asymmetric barrier synchronization.

// MasterBarrier / WorkerBarrier.
//
// This is a simple master/worker barrier that is mapped to locations
// within a shared integer array.
//
// The purpose of this barrier is to allow the master--the main thread
// of the window--not to block, but to receive a callback when the
// workers have all entered the barrier.
//
// Overview
// --------
// The master and workers all create private barrier objects, which
// reference the same working locations in shared memory.  When the
// workers have all entered the barrier the master receives a
// callback.  The master must then release the workers again for them
// to resume computing.
//
// Usage
// -----
// Client code in the master must create a MasterBarrier, and must
// ensure that MasterBarrier.dispatch is invoked when a worker's
// onmessage handler receives a message that the workers are all in
// the barrier.  That message is an array of the form
// ["MasterBarrier.dispatch", ...].  MasterBarrier.dispatch should
// be invoked on the message.
//
// The workers must each create a WorkerBarrier on the same shared
// locations and with the same ID as the master barrier.  The
// WorkerBarriers must not be created until after the MasterBarrier
// constructor has returned.
//
// The application is responsible for allocating the locations in the
// integer array and communicating those and the ID to the workers.
//
// The number of consecutive int32 array locations needed is given by
// MasterBarrier.NUMINTS.

// Create the master side of a barrier.
//
// - 'iab' is an Int32Array on shared memory.
// - 'ibase' is the first of MasterBarrier.NUMINTS consecutive locations
//   within 'iab'
// - 'ID' identifies the barrier globally
// - 'numWorkers' is the number of workers that will coordinate
// - 'callback' is the function that is to be called when the workers
//   are all waiting in the barrier with this ID.
//
// 'iab', 'ibase', 'ID', and 'numWorkers' are exposed on the object.

function MasterBarrier(iab, ibase, ID, numWorkers, callback) {

// in fact be waiting because the last worker could have entered after
// the check was performed but before isQuiescent() returned.

// Otherwise release them and return true.
//
// Note that if the result is false the workers may all in fact be
// waiting because the last worker could have entered after the check
// was performed but before isQuiescent() returned.

// The barrier is immediately reusable after the workers are released.
