// Proof of concept: A simple asymmetric master/worker futex mechanism.
//
// In the master, create a MasterFutex for each shared array that
// we'll wait on.  In each worker, create corresponding WorkerFutexes.
//
// In the master's message event handler for each worker, be sure to
// call MasterFutex.dispatch as described below.
//
// The master can now provide nonblocking wait for signals from the
// workers.  There can be multiple pending waits and several waits can
// wait on the same location.
//
// See ../test/test-asymmetric-futex.html for example code.

"use strict";

// Desiderata / Facts of life:
//
//  - There can be multiple outstanding waits in the master, because
//    the master effectively multiplexes many threads of control
//  - Many of these waits can wait on the same location, but they can
//    also all wait on different locations
//  - There is only one master, normally the main thread.  Everyone else,
//    normally the workers, should use futexWait for waiting
//  - The workers can use a dedicated wakeup to wake the master,
//    it need not be integrated with the normal futexWake
//  - It is useful if the wait mechanism is like futexWait, in that
//    it takes an expected value for an int32 cell
//
// Design:
//
//  - Each "cell" is two consecutive int32 locations, the first holds
//    the value and the second is a private coordination word which
//    must initially be zero
//  - The value location must only be accessed with atomic operations
//  - For each location - an (array,index) pair - the master keeps
//    track of callbacks to be invoked for a wakeup
//  - The coordination word consists of a count field and some flag
//    bits.  The count field tracks the number of waiters for which
//    a wakeup message has not been sent (some of the wakeups may
//    be pending).

// Unused: 2

const _WW_MAX = 0x0FFFFFFF;     // Max count value

// TODO:
//
// Implement a wait timeout, if a timeout then the callback should be
// invoked with Atomics.TIMEDOUT.  Note this will significantly
// complicate the protocol: if there is a wakeup message in transit
// for the timed-out waiter then that message must not wake count
// waiters, but count-1.  This may be fixable by replacing the
// timed-out waiter in the callbacks array with some sentinel value,
// so that we account for it properly.  But that leaves the question
// of how to manage the count of waiters.
//
// Alternatively, add MasterFutex.cancel(cb) so that client code can
// manage a timeout independently.  This does not remove the problem
// with in-transit wakeups.
//
// Optimize the code with an in-band signal, eg, Waiter.prototype.wait
// can recognize that there are wakeups in transit, and can invoke
// some pending callbacks directly.  This has at least the same
// complication as for the timeout, and additionally(?) we must track
// the number of in-transit signals.
//
// (Likely just having a count of in-transit wakeups per location is
// good enough, this doubles as high-water mark for the queue of
// callbacks.  If a canceled callback is within that range then the
// count of waiters should not be decremented; if it is outside the
// range the count must be decremented, and the item could even be
// removed.  The count of in-transit wakeups is decremented only by
// the dispatch code.  But - is there room for races here?)
//
// Can further optimize the in-band signal by spinning or
// micro-waiting on the "expected" value to be set.  This is more
// reasonably implemented as part of a synchronic abstraction though.
//
// An interesting optimization is that a wait on one location can run
// callbacks for in-transit wakeups also for other locations on that
// and other arrays.
//
// None of those optimizations may matter much in applications where
// only one futexWait is outstanding, and those may be typical.  What
// might matter is a method on the MasterFutex (or even a static
// method on MasterFutex) to check for in-transit wakeups and run
// callbacks when appropriate; this can be used to improve
// responsiveness in longer-running main-thread loops.
